DiaryFrameWork
A simple Java-based object-oriented framework for managing different types of diary entries, including text, mood, and activity-based notes.

🚀 About This Project
This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, such as:

Abstraction via the AbstractDiaryEntry class

Inheritance & Polymorphism with classes like TextDiaryEntry, MoodDiaryEntry, and ActivityDiaryEntry

Encapsulation through well-structured class design and private fields

A central Diary class that allows adding, storing, and displaying entries

✨ Why This Project?
This was built to strengthen my Java programming fundamentals and practice clean, reusable code design. It's beginner-friendly and extensible—for example, you can add image entries, audio logs, or search/filter features later!
